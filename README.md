# CM-COMPILER
Welcome to the Complete Compiler Front End in C++. This project, based on a simple compiler model, includes lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and intermediate code generation. The C++ implementation covers packages for main, lexer, symbol, parser, and inter, transforming source code into an abstract syntax tree and generating three-address code.
